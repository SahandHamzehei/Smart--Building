# Heating-Cooling Monitoring and Power Consumption Forecasting Using LSTM for Energy-Efficient Smart Management of Buildings

## Introduction
Energy management in smart homes stands at the forefront of addressing Quality of Life (QoL) concerns and ensuring efficient use of energy resources. Amidst looming threats of environmental contamination, this research harnesses the potential of green computing-backed AI solutions, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The goal? To craft cloud/fog/edge-empowered predictions regarding building energy consumption.

## Abstract
This study delves deep into the world of AI, utilizing the LSTM algorithm to understand the intricacies of predicting building energy consumption. We pivot our focus on four pivotal parameters: power electricity, power heating, power cooling, and total powerâ€”especially in cold-climate office/home settings. Leveraging collected data, the LSTM's prowess is assessed to forecast these parameters for an upcoming year, enabling accurate predictions of energy consumption while maintaining an online monitor of the model's performance across diverse scenarios. Various AI predictive tools are scrutinized to facilitate this endeavor. The outcomes, derived from simulations, hold a promising outlook for future implementations.

## Key Findings
- LSTM's capability in forecasting building energy consumption is promising, especially in cold-climate settings.
- Green computing-backed AI offers a sustainable solution to smart home energy management challenges.
- The study sheds light on the online performance monitoring of LSTM under diverse conditions.
